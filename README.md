The repository consists of all the tasks as a part of my Internship at Bharat Intern

Task 1: House Price Prediction

In conclusion, the House Price Prediction project, powered by the application of linear regression, has demonstrated a remarkable accuracy of 91.22%. This achievement signifies the effectiveness of the model in capturing intricate relationships within the dataset and making reliable predictions. The project's success underscores the significance of data-driven approaches in real-world scenarios and highlights the potential for informed decision-making in the dynamic realm of real estate. As we move forward, this accomplishment encourages further exploration and refinement of predictive models, propelling us toward more accurate and insightful solutions in the realm of housing market analysis.

Task 2: Iris Classification

ðŸŒº The task revolved around the fascinating world of Iris flowers, where I dived deep into classifying these blooms into distinct species based on intriguing parameters like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The challenge was to unravel the mysteries of each iris and predict whether it's an Iris setosa, Iris virginica, or Iris versicolor.

ðŸŒ· Leveraging the prowess of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), I embarked on a thrilling journey of model development. And guess what? The results are phenomenal! ðŸš€

ðŸŒ¼ KNN wowed us with an impressive accuracy of 92.11%, ensuring precise species prediction. ðŸŒ± The Random Forest Classifier held its ground with a commendable 89.47% accuracy, showcasing its robust capabilities. And the star of the show, the Support Vector Classifier, dazzled with an astounding 94.73% accuracy, standing tall as a testament to its power in accurate classification.

ðŸŒ¿ Working with the Iris Dataset and crafting models that deciphered the species of these flowers based on their unique attributes was truly rewarding. It's been an enlightening experience delving into the world of data, algorithms, and predictions.
